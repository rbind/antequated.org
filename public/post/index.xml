      <description>Polar maps are still hot! Last time we got this far by creating a very simplistic polar map and discussing some of the difficulties in customizing and finishing it. Since then Dale Maschette discussed these problems at useR Brisbane 2018 and stirred up multiple discussions on twitter about the joys of polar maps.
Behold SOmap.
 SOmap To install the SOmap package use
remotes::install_github(&amp;quot;AustralianAntarcticDivision/SOmap&amp;quot;) and see the package readme and documentation for further details.</description>

      <description>Map projections are a hot topic! What do we need?
a data manipulation and visualization environment coordinate transformation tools a coordinate reference system (‘crs’) data  Here they are:
## 1. R is a data manipulation and visualization environment ## R can do work with map projections using extension packages ## install.packages(&amp;quot;sf&amp;quot;) ## install.packages(&amp;quot;rnaturalearth&amp;quot;) ## 2. sp and rgdal provide map data manipulation and transformation library(sp) library(rgdal) ## rgdal: version: 1.</description>

      <description>Editorial note: This work is carried out using generally available R packages from CRAN. The content in this document was prepared before it was published, and in this form it may again be updated. There’s also a step where some CCAMLR polygons are read in from shapefiles that must be manually downloaded. In future we can remove this requirement and make things much easier. 
Get ready Required R packages.</description>
